that you couldn’t care less to be on social media, to be in the crowd and to own a smartphone.
your awareness of the heresthetics and your rage at injustice.
your humble attitude, sensitive humour, careful use of language, and most of all the cheerful and happy disposition that’s gradually making a change to the surrounding.  
your great fondness of art and your love of Kafka.
your connection with siblings, parents, grandparents, your caring nature for young and old, your respect for friends and how genuine you are to all others. 
your lively and uninhibited smiles, occasional goofy jokes >_< 
that even though you’re unfairly treated you stay polite and respond conscientiously…
how the expressions from you sound like wisdom sayings.
how all the trivial things matter when it comes to you and how precious you think they are. 
your willingness to listen to my stories.  
how a seemingly random reply of yours has brought consistency and sparked joy for the years to come.
your sympathy for sufferings and the empathy.
your commitment to people and things you love.
the way you feel shy.
the patience you have when it comes to the end of an exhausting discussion.
the bees you saved.
the fact that you have faith and trust.
the many poems you wrote.
the spread of your value and your subtle protest against Liberalism.
your choice of the finest ingredients, sugar-free ice creams and the idea of making someone special.
your constant support to people who are in pressure, as simple as, in your words "much power".
the Alice you've drawn once on a canvas that has been since symbolised a good sleep.
the warm greetings and wishes at all time.
your non-stop light-hearted chatter.
your singing voice, although very few people have actually heard it.
how you persevere to get things done.
how loyal you are to your friends.
