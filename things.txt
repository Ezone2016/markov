that you couldn’t care less to be on social media, to be in the crowd and to own a smartphone.
your awareness of the heresthetics and your rage at injustice.
your humble attitude, sensitive humor, careful use of language, and most of all this cheerful and happy disposition that’s gradually making a change of the surrounding.  
your great fondness of art, poem and your love of Kafka.
your connections with siblings, parents, grandparents, your caring nature for young and old, your respect to friends and how genuine you are to all others. 
your lively and uninhibited smiles, occasional goofy jokes >_< 
that even though you’re unfairly treated you stay polite and respond conscientiously…
how the expressions from you sound like wisdom sayings.
how all the trivial things matter and how precious you think they are. 
your willingness to listen to my stories.  
how a seemingly random reply of yours has brought consistency and sparked joy for the years to come.
your sympathy for sufferings and your empathy.
your commitment to things and people you love.
the way you feel shy.
the patience you have when it comes to the end of an exhausting discussion.
the bees you saved.
the fact that you have faith and trust.
the many poems you wrote for people special.
